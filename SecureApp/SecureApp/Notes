How to Secure an iOS App?

Security is critical for protecting user data, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. Below are key areas to focus on when securing an iOS app.


******

1Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Data Storage
üîπ Avoid Storing Sensitive Data in UserDefaults
‚úÖ Use Keychain Instead:

******

2Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Network Communication
üîπ Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS)
Always use HTTPS (not HTTP) for network requests.
Enable App Transport Security (ATS) to enforce SSL.

******


3Ô∏è‚É£ SSL Certificate Pinning
Protect against Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks by using SSL Certificate Pinning.
GTS_Root_R1.cer used in this project is "https://www.google.com" link certificate which is taken from safari.

Types of SSL Pinning:
1. SSL Pinning using Certificate
2. SSL Pinning using server Public key

4Ô∏è‚É£ Protect Against Jailbreak Exploits
üîπ Detect Jailbroken Devices
Jailbroken devices allow attackers to modify app behavior.


******

5Ô∏è‚É£ Secure User Authentication
üîπ Use Biometric Authentication (Face ID/Touch ID)
Use Case: Adds an extra layer of security before accessing sensitive data.


Your Info.plist file should look something like this:

<key>Privacy - Face ID Usage Description</key>
<string>This app uses Face ID for secure authentication.</string>

Testing Biometric Authentication:

To test biometric authentication on the iOS Simulator:

1. Enable Face ID: Go to Simulator > Features > Face ID > Enrolled
2. Test with a Matching Face: Go to Simulator > Features > Face ID > Matching Face
3. Test with a Non-matching Face: Go to Simulator > Features > Face ID > Non-matching Face
